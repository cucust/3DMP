# Final Project - Bear Coin Bank
For my final project I've chosen to design a coin bank in the shape of a bear. The coins are inserted via a tray in the bear's hand, which then slide into the now-opened mouth after rotating the head. I have chosen to work on this design because of both it's usefulness in daily life and it's endearing appearance.

### How it works

The mechanism can be divided into the following main components:
   - body
   - arms & tray
   - head
   - eye
   - bottom cap

Rotating the head leads to the opening of the mouth and the upper rotation of the arm & tray, leading to the coin situated on the tray to fall inside the coin bank, which can be later retrieved by opening the cap situated on the bottom of the mechanism.
