# 3DMP - Homework 4
<br>

1. Watch and understand the courses videos about Rotational to Linear Motion and Vice-Versa mechanisms (Bonus: we recommend to model them on your own as well)
2. Design the Scotch Yoke Mechanism taking the course videos as reference (especially the slider crank mechanism; in this one can see why it’s important to use Fusion Rule Number 1)
3. Choose ONE mechanism from the next list and design it in Fusion:

Requirements for 2 and 3:
* Divide the mechanism into components
* Use Fusion Rule Number 1
* Design the model having in mind that it will be 3D printed (Create a stand for the mechanism - like “Holder” component made in Course 5 videos - so they will not levitate)
* Use suggestive names for your bodies, components, sketches, joints, contact points, construction planes or any element that you include in your project
* Add appearances
* Add joints
* Create a motion study
* Render the mechanism (upload a rendering photo to GitHub as well)
OBS: Turn on capture history (the homework will not be graded if capture history is not turned on). You need to upload the project as .f3d and a .stl for each projects’ body and component.
BONUS:  Make a video rendering with the mechanism displaying the motion study. Use the result to make a video tutorial where you present how the mechanism is working.
